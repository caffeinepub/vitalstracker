It must display a rotating set of healthy activity suggestions (e.g., 'Take a 10-minute walk', 'Do 5 minutes of deep breathing', 'Drink a glass of water', 'Stand up and stretch'). The suggestions should cycle automatically every 15–20 seconds and also include a 'Next Suggestion' button so the user can advance manually. Style the component to match the existing medical-grade dark theme (dark navy/charcoal background, teal accent text and border, clinical sans-serif font) with a subtle glow consistent with the existing metric cards.",
