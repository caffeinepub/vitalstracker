  "summary": "The diff implements a SuggestionBox component and integrates it into the Layout component, satisfying nearly all acceptance criteria for REQ-11. The component includes 12 diverse suggestions (exceeding the 10 minimum), auto-rotates every 18 seconds (within the 15–20 second window), includes a Next Suggestion button, uses teal accent colors and dark theme styling with glow, and is placed below main content in the Layout flow. All acceptance criteria appear to be met.",
