  "summary": "The diff implements all four requirements with high fidelity. REQ-7 is satisfied by the existing addVitalsReading method in backend/main.mo (and an added addSimulatedReading method). REQ-8 is implemented via useAutonomousMonitor.ts and vitalsSimulator.ts. REQ-9 is addressed in Dashboard.tsx with last-recorded time and countdown. REQ-10 is addressed in Layout.tsx with a teal pulsing monitoring pill. One minor concern: the pill turning grey when errored/inactive needs verification from the truncated Layout.tsx, but the monitoringActive flag is present in the code. The addSimulatedReading backend method skips validation, which is a slight deviation but the frontend uses addVitalsReading anyway.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-10",
      "requirement": "The pill turns grey/inactive if the monitoring loop errors out or is paused.",
      "reason": "Layout.tsx is truncated and while the monitoringActive flag is computed correctly (isActive && !error), it cannot be fully confirmed that the pill renders in a grey/inactive state when monitoringActive is false — only the teal active state rendering is visible in the diff.",

    {
      "description": "A dedicated addSimulatedReading backend method was added that bypasses all validation for simulated readings.",
      "reason": "The build request only required reusing or adding a method that accepts programmatically generated readings — it did not specify skipping validation. Additionally, the frontend hook uses addVitalsReading (not addSimulatedReading), making the new method unused by the autonomous loop.",
